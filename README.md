# File Conversion Tool

A file conversion tool that allows users to select from XML, CSV, EXCEL, or JSON  files and convert them to another user defined format. Users can also preview all data prior to conversion, or view raw data without converting at all. Users can submit custom SQL Teradata queries, preview the data, and save the results. Analysis tools such as merging file types and data summaries are available as well. If issues arise, a bug report form is included in the application.

Python is the main language used, the GUI is created through Tkinter. Currently working on making a enhanced GUI using the customtkinter package!
